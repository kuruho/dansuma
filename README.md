### What does "Kuruho" mean?

The origin of the name kuruho comes from a mantra.
In fact on the net is more and more difficult to
find names not previously used.
The full mantra is from the Green Tara series,
and sounds

Om Bema Tare Sendara Hri Sarva Loka Washum Kuruho

It is believed to be the mantra increasing your force.
